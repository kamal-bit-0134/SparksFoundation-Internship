In this program we used OpenCV function to detect the color of the image. Functions used are imread(), using setMouseCallback() for selecting the space of which the color is to be obtained. The fetched color combination in RGB format is displayed on the window.Colour values are compared with the RGB values of CSV file and those values with a minimum absolute difference are picked as our colour and then we draw a rectangle within the image to show up the RGB values and the associated colour with the value.
